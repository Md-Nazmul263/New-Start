        <h2>The Red Maulana</h2>
        <p class="description">
            <b>Bhasani, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan</b>. Popularly known as <b>Maulana Bhasani</b>, Abdul Hamid Khan was self-educated, village-based, a fire-brand, and skeptical about colonial institutions. Though immensely influential throughout his political career and instrumental in winning many general and local government elections since 1946, he consistently stayed away from holding actual power. His leadership was rooted in his relentless and incessant struggle for safeguarding the rights and interests of the peasantry and the labouring classes.
